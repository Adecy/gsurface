# gsurface library

This library offers tools for simulating and plotting single or structured point mass(es) guided by 2D surfaces according to a the Newton 2nd Law Approach

Following surfaces are defined: Plan, Sphere, Tore, Catenoid, Canonical Corner, Eggbox, Paraboloids + TranslatedSurfaceGenerator, RevolutionSurfaceGenerator

Following forces are defined: Spring, Viscous & Air Friction, (Distance) Gravity, EM forces, SpringDamping, Interactions

Any Surface Force or Model can be implemented over this Library

## Simple example

1. Brachistochrone symetric surface

TODO

2. Twisted brachistochrone surface

TODO

3. Interacted solids on brachistochrone surface

TODO

More examples can be found in the `examples` directory.
