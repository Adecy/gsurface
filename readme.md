# gsurface library

This library offers tools for simulating and plotting single or structured point mass(es) guided by 2D surfaces according to the Newton 2nd Law Approach
Following surfaces are defined: Plan, Sphere, Tore, Catenoid, Canonical Corner, Eggbox, Paraboloids + TranslatedSurfaceGenerator, RevolutionSurfaceGenerator
Following forces are defined: Spring, Viscous & Air Friction, (Distance) Gravity, EM forces, SpringDamping, Interactions
Any Surface Force or Model can be implemented over this Library (this guide explains how to proceed).

Examples can be found in the `examples` directory.
