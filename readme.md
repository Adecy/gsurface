# gsurface library

This library offers tools for simulating and plotting single or structured point solid(s) moving on 2D surfaces using a Newtonian approach.
Following surfaces are defined: Plan, Sphere, Tore, Catenoid, Canonical Corner, Eggbox, Paraboloids
Following forces are defined: Spring, Viscous & Air Friction, (Distance) Gravity, EM forces, SpringDamping, Interactions
Any Surface Force or Model can be implemented over this Library (this guide explains how to proceed).
